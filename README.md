# docker-latex

Docker container for assembling LaTeX files. Includes full scheme of TexLive distribution.
This repository is heavily based on (this repository)[https://github.com/blang/latex-docker],
but containes a fresher version of TexLive (2021 instaed of 2017).

## Usage

You can enter LaTeX environment simply by running `latexenv.sh` script.
It is based on prebuilt docker container, so you don't need to assemble on
